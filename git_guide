To see the new "built ins" branch in your local repository, run:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

This fetches updates from the remote. Then, to see all branches (local and remote):

```bash
git branch -a
```

To switch to and track the remote "built ins" branch locally:

```bash
git checkout --track origin/"built ins"
```

Or if the branch name has spaces, you might need quotes in some contexts:

```bash
git checkout --track origin/built\ ins
```
GIT FETCH v/s GIT PULL:

git fetch - Safe, no merge

Downloads changes from remote
Updates what you know about the remote branch
Doesn't change your current branch
You can review changes before deciding what to do

git pull - Fetch + Merge automatically

Downloads changes from remote
Automatically merges them into your current branch
If there are conflicts, you have to resolve them

Why fetch over pull for group work:

git fetch origin              # See what changed
git diff origin/"built ins"   # Review differences safely
git merge origin/"built ins"  # Merge only when ready

Why pull if you trust your teammates:
git pull origin "built ins"   # One command, done

TL;DR: Use fetch if you want control and to review changes first. 
Use pull if you want speed and trust the changes. For group projects, fetch is safer.

=> Adding changes from buletin and built-ins branches top main branch

Ran terminal command:  git branch -a

You have `built-ins` (local), `buletin` (remote only), and `main` branches. Here are the **merge steps**:

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main and it's up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Merge built-ins branch into main
git merge built-ins

# 3. Merge buletin branch into main
git merge origin/buletin
```

If there are **conflicts**, git will tell you. Resolve them manually in conflicted files, then:
```bash
git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "Merge built-ins and buletin into main"
git push origin main
```
